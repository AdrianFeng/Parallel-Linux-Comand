   For this part, Our implementation includes two parts. The first one is
 that read the input file content and then check to see if the input content
 has something that does not fall into the shell syntax subset and also check
 the code grammer to see if it has some undefined behavior. Finally, put the
 space at the place where there is supposed to be one to separate the command.

   After doing all those check, we separate the input stream by the the space
 and then construct a command line tree, whose node is a simple command.
  Also we use "()" to find the subshell command, which is a special case for
this project.

  Therefore, overall, our implementation works just fine and passes all the
  test cases.
